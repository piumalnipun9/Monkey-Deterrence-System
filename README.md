# Monkey-Deterrence-System
Excited to Share Our Innovative Circuit Crafters Project: Monkey Deterrence System! 🐒🌿  

We’ve successfully completed our **Engineering Design project** in Semester 2 under the **EN1190 module**!  
This project focuses on designing an **environmentally friendly, non-invasive solution** to mitigate crop damage caused by monkeys using **cutting-edge technology**.  

## 🔹 Key Features:  
✔ **High-Frequency Sound Emission** – Creates an acoustically hostile environment for monkeys  
✔ **PIR & RCWL-0516 Sensors** – Advanced motion detection  
✔ **SIM800L Module** – Real-time SMS notifications for monkey presence  

## Future Enhancements  
✔ **Solar-Powered Operation** – Sustainable and eco-friendly  
✔ **Adaptive Frequency Control** – Enhanced efficiency in repelling monkeys  

To tackle field limitations, we plan to integrate **IoT-based analytics** for remote monitoring and data insights.  

🌟 **Advancing agriculture and wildlife management through innovative tech solutions!**  

🔥 Huge thanks to our incredible team and mentors for their guidance and support! 🙌
